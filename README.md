# voronoiMaps
Playing around with Javascript and math.

This started out as a experiment in generating random maps for territory based games like Diplomacy,
and still sort of is. Mostly it's just an excuse to play around with some Javascript and math though.

There's a couple steps here:

1. Generate a voronoi diagram with n sites

2. From that map, divide the sites into 'land' and 'water' cells somewhat intelligently

3. Use the land and water regions to generate random land masses. Yay!
